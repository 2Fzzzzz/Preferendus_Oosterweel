# Preferendus

This repository contains the code for the Preferendus, a multi-objective design and decision support optimisation tool 
which is part of the Open Design Systems optimisation methodology. For further details, the reader is referred to 
Van Heukelum, Binnekamp, and Wolfert (under review, expected 2023).

# Inter-generational solver
Part of the Preferendus is an adapted Genetic Algorithm solver which allows for proper optimisation in the preference domain.
Where due, references are listed in the source code. For details on the solver, the reader is referred to the previously mentioned paper.
